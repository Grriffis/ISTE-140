			<h2>What is Chemical Engineering</h2>

			<p>Chemical engineering applies the core scientific disciplines of chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics to transform raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms, invariably in processes that involve chemical change. All engineers employ mathematics, physics, and engineering to overcome technical problems in a safe and economical fashion. The chemical engineer provides the critical level of expertise needed to solve problems in which chemical specificity and change have particular relevance. They not only create new, more effective ways to manufacture chemicals, they also work collaboratively with chemists to pioneer the development of high-tech materials for specialized applications. Well-known contributions include the development and commercialization of synthetic rubber, synthetic fiber, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Chemical engineers contribute significantly to advances in the food industry, alternative energy systems, semiconductor manufacturing, and environmental modeling and remediation. A special focus on process engineering cultivates a systems perspective that makes chemical engineers extremely versatile and capable of handling a wide spectrum of technical problems.</p>

		<h2>Skills Learned</h2>

		<p>Students obtain skills in analyzing traditional chemical engineering unit operations and systems as well as understanding underlying principles and measurement techniques associated with the core of a chemical engineering process. They design chemical engineering processes within specified constraints that involve one or more process units, assembly and disassembly of components and they identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems and validate their solutions with self-consistency checks and well-designed experiments. Students use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice: MATLAB, EXCEL, CHEMCAD, and LABVIEW. Students become skilled and hands-on at the lab, bench, and larger scales, and will be able to utilize commonly encountered equipment ranging from tri-clover fittings to Brookfield viscometers.</p>
